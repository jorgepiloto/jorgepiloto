#### About me

My name is Jorge Martínez Garrido and I am an undergraduate aerospace engineer.
After starting my degree, I became interested in scientific computing applied to
the aerospace world, in particular to the orbital mechanics field. Lots of my 
projects and contributions are realted with this astronautics branch, check them
out in my repository hub!


#### Personal website
I also like writting content in my own website, which you can visit in the
following link: [on-orbit.dev](https://on-orbit.dev). Several articles on
programming, electronics and daily experiences are available there. You can also
find interesting links to other websites or blogs I like to read in my free time.
